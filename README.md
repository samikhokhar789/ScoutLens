# ScoutLens

ScoutLens is a Chrome extension that provides an enhanced UI/UX experience for [Scout Game](https://scoutgame.xyz/), much like how Complexity enhanced Perplexity. It serves two main purposes: as an experimental ground for testing new interface and UX ideas, and as a tool for delivering improved scout and developer-related visualizations and information within Scout Game.
